scimitar.hs is compiler for a simple Scheme-like language
targetting Lambda-Man CPU.

m.sh will compile scimitar.hs -- this requires GHC reasonably
similar to mine, which most current GHCs should be.

buildall.pl will build the compiler, then compile all *.scm
files in the code/ directory to corresponding *.gcc -- this
one requires Perl 5 reasonably similar to mine, which most
current Perls should also be.
